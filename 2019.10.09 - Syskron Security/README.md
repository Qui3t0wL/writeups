This was, I think, my first CtF challenge ever. I hadn't expectations in what kind of challenges I would find so my mindset was learning, learning a lot. My overall balance it's very positive, I liked a lot, although I only managed to solve 13 challenges.

The first teams was **0x90r00t** and **Gutenberg** with 8941 points, next in 3rd place **HgbSec** with 8771 points.
